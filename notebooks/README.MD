## Notebooks description

* ***VQE_Implementation_in_Qiskit.ipynb***: VQE algorithm for LiH energy; taken with minimum changes from Qiskit tutorials.

* ***VQE_H3.ipynb***: First implementation of VQE for H3 and H3+. Code not efficient at all and with some errors.

* ***H3+_triangular_energy.ipynb***: optimization of previous notebook, currently the core of the project. Energy calculated for different interatomic distances for a triangular geometry.

* ***H3+_linear_energy.ipynb***: Energy calculated for different interatomic distances for a linear geometry.

* ***Basis analysis(FCI).ipynb***: Energy calculated with different basis set with Full Configuration Interaction 

* ***Hardware efficient ansatz(es).ipynb***: VQE with noise (ibmq_santiago) and different ansatz
