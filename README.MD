# MEQuVA

Molecular Energy estimation with Quantum Variational Algorithm

## Files and Folders description

* ***docs***: contains documentation.

* ***notebooks***: contains jupyter notebooks, further file's description available in the folder readme.

* ***requirements.txt***: list of installed packages used for the virtual python environment (python version: 3.8.5).

## Problems / not yet implemented features

* How can I run VQE on real quantum hardware?

* I could use a statevector simulator with noise.

* Ground state energy and interatomic distance is not precisely what I expected.

* H3.

* Excited states.

* ~~Linear geometry for H3+.~~
